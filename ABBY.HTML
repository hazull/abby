                <p> I particularly enjoy films that challenge my mind or offer intriguing plots. One such movie I loved is The Queen's Gambit, which is not just about chess but also a compelling story of personal growth, strategy, and overcoming obstacles.  It’s a hobby that not only entertains me but also broadens my perspective on different aspects of life and culture.
